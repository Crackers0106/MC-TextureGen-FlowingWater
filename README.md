# MC Texture Generator
A Java program that programatically generates textures generated by certain versions of Minecraft at runtime, and then saves them to individual files.

Currently, this program generates textures from the following Minecraft versions:
- Minecraft 4k-1
- Minecraft 4k-2

### How to generate the textures.

Make sure to have a Java runtime environment of 7 or higher installed on your computer. The easiest way to run this program is just to double click the .jar file, which will generate and save all textures to a folder named "GeneratedTextures". The .jar file can also be run from the command line. Doing so will allow you to see log output when generating the textures, which can be useful if you need to debug anything. When this program is run from the command line, the "GeneratedTextures" folder will be placed at the current directory that your command line is in.

### Why have a dedicated program for this?

The idea behind this program is to create an improvably accurate source for these textures - if this code contains any mistakes, the mistakes can simply be fixed, and the textures will then be generated accurately. The same improvement in accuracy cannot be achieved for an inaccurate screenshot, or a file accidentally saved in a reduced resolution or color depth.
